                        <h2>Networks</h2>

                        <p>Ashley Communications has an extensive network of high level radio repeater sites.</p>
                        <p>We have solutions available for almost any communication requirement, ranging from a few radios in a local area right up to nationwide coverage for hundreds of radios. Our shared service options allow us to offer incredibly cost effective coverage.</p>
                        <p>We can custom design strategically located repeaters (both temporary and permanent) to cover specific events or areas that aren't already covered by existing networks, and we have options for factory communications too.</p>
                        <p>VHF radio allows us to cover a large area where traditional cellular coverage doesn't quite reach, and is usually much more reliable in a major event.</p>
                        <p>We also can offer last mile internet services, both temporary (remote events) and permanent.</p>
                        <p>If you require reliable and cost effective communications, <a href="#contact">contact us</a> today.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>

                        <p>Ashley Communications is a modern company with a long history in the South Canterbury and North Otago regions.</p>
                        <p>The original company, Ashley's Electronics Ltd, was founded in the mid 1930's and among other things charged batteries and sold bicycles! The focus then shifted to televisions, and then changed direction again during the 1970's when we became a Tait mobile radio dealer.</p>
                        <p>In 1984 David Thomson purchased the business from the original Ashley family.</p>
                        <p>The Government deregulation of the radio industry in 1989 cleared the way for Ashley's Electronics to move from not just providing two way radio equipment but also providing radio network services and at this point the company began to develop its own high level repeater sites. From then our network has kept on expanding and we are proud to be able to offer bespoke radio network solutions to our customers today.</p>
                        <p>Ashley Electronics Ltd changed hands again in 2020 to the current owners Carl and Shonagh Garner, and was renamed to Ashley Communications Ltd to better reflect the main focus of the business.</p>
